# Coding Challenge - React Native

Inventory is a small utility app that could be used in logistics. It has two use cases: 

b. Adding products to the inventory using a bar code scanner
a. Viewing the inventory of products

The app is built using Expo, TypeScript, React Native Paper and Redux. The backend is a REST API provided by Airtable.

The coding challenge's goal is to expand the Inventory app. Pick 

## Tasks (pick one!)

a. Airtable's REST API allows for 100 items to be fetched in one request. In order to show all results, expand the `fetchInventory` thunk action with pagination using the `offset` parameter.

b. Create a `setFilter` action along with a search input on top of the `HomeScreen` component to enable the user to filter for inventory items by product code. 



b. Add a search box on top of the `HomeScreen` component that enables the user to filter for inventory items by product code.
